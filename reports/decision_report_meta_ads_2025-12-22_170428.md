## Recommendation Summary

```
=== Recommendation Summary ===
risk_profile: balanced
action: REDUCE
confidence: 0.000 (LOW)
downside_risk: 1.000 (HIGH)
why: Risk is too high right now. Reduce budget and diagnose issues (tracking, creatives, audience, landing page) before scaling again.
```

## Decision Details

- action: REDUCE

- reason: Downside risk is extreme (1.000 ≥ 0.55). Reduce spend and investigate.

- user_explanation: Risk is too high right now. Reduce budget and diagnose issues (tracking, creatives, audience, landing page) before scaling again.


---

## Why this decision?

### What happened

- Downside risk spiked to 1.000, above the REDUCE threshold for balanced.

- The system sees a high chance of negative net outcomes if you continue at this spend level.


### What could go wrong

- Continuing current spend may amplify losses while the signal is unstable.

- If tracking or conversion quality is broken, scaling decisions will be misleading.


### What to do next

- Reduce spend immediately to control downside exposure.

- Validate tracking, conversion integrity, and data quality.

- Re-run the engine after 7 more days of stable data.
