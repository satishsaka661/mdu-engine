## Recommendation Summary

```
=== Recommendation Summary ===
risk_profile: balanced
action: REDUCE
confidence: 0.250 (LOW)
downside_risk: 0.584 (HIGH)
why: Risk is too high right now. Reduce budget and diagnose issues (tracking, creatives, audience, landing page) before scaling again.
```

## Decision

- **Action:** REDUCE

- **Reason:** Downside risk is extreme (0.584 ≥ 0.55). Reduce spend and investigate.

- **User Explanation:** Risk is too high right now. Reduce budget and diagnose issues (tracking, creatives, audience, landing page) before scaling again.

## Why this decision?

### What happened

- Downside risk spiked to 0.584, above the REDUCE threshold for balanced.
- The system sees a high chance of negative net outcomes if you continue at this spend level.

### What could go wrong

- Continuing current spend may amplify losses while the signal is unstable.
- If tracking or conversion quality is broken, scaling decisions will be misleading.

### What to do next

- Reduce spend immediately to control downside exposure.
- Validate tracking, conversion integrity, and data quality.
- Re-run the engine after 7 more days of stable data.
